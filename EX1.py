# Exercise â€“ 1: Filename: ex1.py
# Implement the function ruler() which takes a number (for example, 43) as argument,
# and produces output as shown below.
#  1 2 3 4
#  1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123
# (note: 1st row values are aligned to respective 0s of the 2nd row)
# Test correctness of the function with the following values :
#  5, 10, 25, 51 and 80
#
